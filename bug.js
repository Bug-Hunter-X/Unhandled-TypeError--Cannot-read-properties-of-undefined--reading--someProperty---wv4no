This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when you're using functional components with useState and try to access the state variable inside a function that's called before the component has fully mounted.

Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  // Error: Trying to access data before it's set
  const displayData = () => {
    console.log(data.someProperty); // Might throw an error if data is null
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Display Data" onPress={displayData} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
